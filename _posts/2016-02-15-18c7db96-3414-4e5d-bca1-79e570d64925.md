#### Brainstorming Sessions

Via
Skype, phone or in person (when possible). We can talk through ideas 
and options to build your profile positively. Just a few of the areas 
we can help with include:

* how to build your online community
* all aspects of creating an active and engaging Facebook page
* ideas for staying front of mind offline as well as online
* out of the box ways to promote yourself

You
are welcome to send through questions and/or a brief outline of what 
you would like to discuss so that our meeting is as productive as 
possible. 

One hour sessions - NZ$100.00, US$80.00, AU$90.00
